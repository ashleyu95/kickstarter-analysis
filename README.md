# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

#### The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise gain some insight on her fundraiser through data of other campaigns. Louise's fundraising goal for the play *Fever* and time is running out. Through this analysis, she wants to know how other campaigns performed in relation to their funding goal and launch dates. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### Looking at the line graph for theater outcomes based on launch dates, we can see that the number of success is at peak for campaigns that launched in May. The number of successful campaigns decreases to the lowest when campaigns launch in December. The line for failed campaigns do not have an obvious peak like the successful line. However, there is a higher number of failed campaigns when launched in the month of May and October. The number of successful and failed campaigns are very close to each other when launched in December. On the other hand, the number of canceled campaigns remains about the same, but there is a gap at the month of October. This could mean that none of the campaigns that launched in October were canceled. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### The line for percentage canceled appears to be a straight line since the percentage for canceled campaigns is 0% no matter what their goals are. The percentage successful line and the percentage failed line are complementary to each other. Looking at the graph formed by the two line, we can see that the two lines are symmetrical. According to the graph, campaigns have a higher percentage success rate when their goals are less than $5000 or between $35000 and $45000. Whereas, campaigns with goals between $25000 and $35000 or more than $45000 have a higher percentage fail rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### There are several challenges and difficulties were encountered throughout the project. When analyzing the outcome based on goals, it is very easy to use the wrong data for the COUNTIFS function to populate the number of success, failed, and canceled. It is also important to isolate the correct variables for the function. For example, I forgot to filter play from the subcategory when I first approach the analysis. When forming the two graphs, it is crucial to select the correct data. For the outcome based on goals graph, I did not choose the correct column for the x-axis. Therefore, the horizontal axis did not show the correct variable.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The first conclusion about the Outcomes based on Launch Date graph is that theater campaigns launched in May are more successful. The second conclusion is that since the number of successful and failed campaigns are close in December, we can conclude that it is not a good idea to launch a campaign during the month of December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - The conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals is that outcomes are closely related to the campaigns' goals, the percentage of success fluctuate as the goal changes. If Louise wants a higher possibility to success, she should set her goal within the range where percentage of success is high. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - There are other factors that might affect how a campaign performs. It is not enough to only look at outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals. Some campaigns might success depending on the duration of the campaign not the launch date of the campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - One of the possible variable that might affect outcome is country. We can look at how theater campaigns perform in different countries. As mentioned in the question above, we can also include the end date of the campaign.
